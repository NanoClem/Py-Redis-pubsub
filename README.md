# Py-Redis-pubsub
A simple use-case of [Redis](https://redis.io/) with python for geospatial querying.


**Since it is an exemple of use of python-redis, I encourage you to enhance it**

## Context / Scenario
You work in a digital company as a consultant. You have been assigned on a fresh new mission in which a client wishes to operate in job hunting area. As he already has his own job search engine, he had an idea to keep a certain degree of relevance : base the research in priority close to a residential place. He asked you to do a quick benchmark of geospacial-data processing methods provided by Redis, since he doesn't know yet its potential.

### How to use it

## Installation
1.If you don't have Python installed yet, [get it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2.You will also need Redis to make querie, just follow [instructions](https://redis.io/download) to install it.

### Setup and Run
1. Since Redis runs on default configurations, just open a terminal and run `redis-server`
2. Init MongoDB with `mongod --port 3000 --dbpath your_data_folder_path`
3. Note that you can make replica sets in MongoDB for more fault tolerance, [see here how to do it](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication)
4. You are now free to run the app ! Go to the project root folder and run `node server/server.js`

## Possible improvements
* Make multiple chat room and the possibility to switch betwwen each other
* Add a login mechanism to avoid any filthy identity theft
* Add more chat commands to display useful information about the chat room
